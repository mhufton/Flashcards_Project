# Flashcards_Project

This project was intended to test my React.js knowledge. 

There were many things in play: state, useEffect, props, and nesting, to name a few. 

I chose to create a DeckRouter file which would store the majority of roues and paths needed for the flashcard, as opposed to bogging down, even moreso, the App.js file.
